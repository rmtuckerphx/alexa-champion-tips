## Tip 3 - Launch Screen
![Even if you are not ready to make your custom skill fully multimodal, add a branded launch screen as an improvement over the default that has only an icon and an exit hint.](tips/tip3.png "Tip 3")

## Tip 4 - Screen Layout
![When designing skill screens using Alexa Presentation Language, start by thinking of the content on the Echo Show and then consider how to summarize it for the Echo Spot and what to add for larger TV screens.](tips/tip4.png "Tip 4")

## Tip 5 - Team Project Structure
![Structure your Alexa project so multiple team members can work on different features at the same time. Start with grouping all handlers for a given feature in a file or go with one file per handler.](tips/tip5.png "Tip 5")

## Tip 6 - Vary Hint & Prompt
![In conversation mode, a response includes speech output & reprompt. The speech output can be further split into message, hint, & prompt. Track usage statistics and remove the hint and modify the prompt over time.](tips/tip6.png "Tip 6")

## Tip 7 - Externalize Settings

## Tip 8 - Speak Up
![Whether it is support of a feature request, let your voice be heard.](tips/tip8.png "Tip 8")
